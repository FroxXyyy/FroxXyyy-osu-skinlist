# Information
This is a GitHub to download original and mixed skins that I created. If you want to mix my skins or use my skin as reference, just to upload it on other websites, please leave a credit to the original work. Or I will hate you.

Please contact me on Discord (FroxXyyy#9066) or via. Osu! DMs if links do not work!

Original skins are credited as "Original" and mixed skins as "Mixed"

If you prefer old versions of a certain skin that is not listed, please feel free to contact me aswell. Maybe I have them on my local disc.

Note that if you want to commision a skin, or other topics you want me to know, you should contact me aswell.

Have fun.
